No blog is complete without a Monad tutorial it seems. The internet is full of tutorials though so I wont provide yet another one. Monads will serve my purpose of exploring category theory and its relation to programming though. So if you are curious about the math underlying all this stuff I hope this will be interesting.

Now, on to monads then. Monads are sometimes defined as nothing more than a monoid in the category of endofunctors. Which is a wonderful definition for our purposes as it provides a good map for the comming exploration. Monoids? Categories? Endofunctors? Oh my this is going to be fun!
